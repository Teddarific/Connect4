TODO (Loosely in order of priority)

-CSS needs to be cleaned up

    -Things are not properly positioned correctly
  
    -Would like a better colour scheme

-AI needs to take priority to closer moves

    -Currently AI will sometimes skip a game-winning move since it thinks moving somewhere else will benefit it in the long return

-Spread the code out into the boardController, rather than have the service act as a back-end

    -Also implement a back-end so we can properly defer the process so the UI doesn't become unresponsive
